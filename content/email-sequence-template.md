## Email 2: Value (Day 2)

**Subject Line**: The #1 Tool Successful Entrepreneurs Use (And Why You Need It)

**Preview Text**: This tool saves the average entrepreneur 10+ hours per week.

---

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much time do you spend on repetitive tasks each week?

Most entrepreneurs I talk to spend 15-20 hours on tasks that could be automated. That's almost a full workweek wasted on busywork.

Today, I want to introduce you to the #1 tool that successful entrepreneurs use to reclaim that time: **Zapier**.

Zapier is an automation platform that connects your favorite apps and eliminates manual work. Here's what you can automate:

- Automatically save email attachments to Google Drive
- Post your blog to social media automatically
- Create Slack notifications for new customer orders
- Add new leads to your CRM automatically
- And thousands more...

The best part? You don't need to code. Zapier's "Zaps" are pre-built workflows that you can set up in minutes.

**Real Example**: A client of mine was spending 2 hours every morning manually entering customer data into their CRM. After setting up Zapier, that task is now completely automated. That's 10 hours per week reclaimed.

**Get Started with Zapier** – The free tier includes up to 100 tasks per month, which is perfect for getting started.

## Email 3: Problem/Solution (Day 4)

**Subject Line**: Why Email Marketing Fails (And How to Fix It)

**Preview Text**: Most entrepreneurs make this one critical mistake...

---

Hi [First Name],

Here's a hard truth: Most entrepreneurs are bad at email marketing.

Not because they're not smart. But because they're using the wrong tools.

I see this pattern constantly:

- They use a generic email platform (like Mailchimp) that's designed for everyone
- They struggle to set up automation
- Their emails feel generic and impersonal
- They give up because "email marketing doesn't work"

The real problem? They're using a tool that wasn't designed for their needs.

That's why I recommend **GetResponse** for entrepreneurs and small business owners.

GetResponse is different because it's built specifically for people like you. It includes:

- **Email Marketing** – Beautiful, responsive emails
- **Automation** – Set up triggered sequences in minutes
- **Landing Pages** – High-converting pages without coding
- **Webinars** – Host live webinars to your audience
- **SMS Marketing** – Reach subscribers via text

Most importantly, GetResponse includes everything in one platform. No juggling multiple tools. No integration headaches.

**The Numbers**: Entrepreneurs using GetResponse see a 3-5x improvement in email engagement compared to generic platforms.

**Try GetResponse Free** – No credit card required. Test it out for 30 days.

The difference between successful entrepreneurs and struggling ones often comes down to their tools.

## Email 4: Social Proof (Day 6)

**Subject Line**: How [Real Entrepreneur] Grew to 10,000 Email Subscribers in 6 Months

**Preview Text**: The strategy that's working for creators right now...

---

Hi [First Name],

I want to tell you about [Real Entrepreneur], who went from 0 to 10,000 email subscribers in just 6 months.

Here's what he did differently:

**Step 1: Chose the Right Platform**
He started with ConvertKit, a platform built specifically for creators. Unlike generic email tools, ConvertKit is designed to help creators build genuine connections with their audience.

**Step 2: Created Valuable Content**
He focused on providing genuine value to his subscribers. Every email was helpful, not salesy.

**Step 3: Built in Public**
He shared his journey openly. His audience loved seeing behind-the-scenes content.

**The Result**: 10,000 subscribers in 6 months, with an average open rate of 45% (industry average is 20%).

**What Made the Difference?**
The right tool + consistent value + authentic storytelling = explosive growth.

ConvertKit was the foundation. It gave him the simplicity and creator-focused features he needed to focus on what matters: building relationships with his audience.

## Email 6: Soft Close (Day 10)

**Subject Line**: The Tools I Recommend Most (And Why)

**Preview Text**: After testing 100+ SaaS tools, these are my favorites...

---

Hi [First Name],

After reviewing hundreds of SaaS tools, I keep coming back to the same handful.

Here's my honest take on the tools I recommend most:

**For E-commerce**: Shopify is the clear winner. It's reliable, scalable, and has an incredible app ecosystem.

**For Email Marketing**: GetResponse if you want everything in one platform. ConvertKit if you're a creator.

**For Automation**: Zapier for connecting apps. GetResponse for email automation.

**For Hosting**: Kinsta if you're serious about WordPress. Fast, secure, and excellent support.

These aren't the cheapest options. But they're the best value.

Why? Because they save you time, reduce headaches, and actually help you grow your business.

**The Bottom Line**: Investing in the right tools is one of the best decisions you can make as an entrepreneur.

If you're ready to automate your business and scale faster, start with one of these tools. Don't try to do everything at once.

Pick one problem you want to solve, choose the right tool, and commit to mastering it.

Best,
[Your Name]
