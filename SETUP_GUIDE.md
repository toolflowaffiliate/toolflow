Here's the best-kept secret in affiliate marketing:

Recurring commissions = passive income.

GetResponse pays 30% EVERY MONTH for as long as your customer stays subscribed.

Example:
- You refer 10 customers at $50/month each
- You earn $150/month FOREVER (or until they cancel)
- After 1 year, you've earned $1,800 from those 10 referrals

Best part? They're easy to sell because email marketing is essential for every business.

   - Expect: 10-50 clicks per post

2. TWITTER (Fastest)
   - Follow #entrepreneur, #saas, #marketing
   - Post: "Just discovered [tool]. Game changer for [benefit]"

**Email 6: Objection Handling (Send Day 5)**
```
Subject: "But I Don't Have an Audience..." (Here's How to Start)

Hi [First Name],

The #1 excuse I hear: "I don't have an audience."

Here's the truth: You don't need an audience. You need TRAFFIC.

Traffic sources that require ZERO followers:
1. Reddit (anonymous, no followers needed)
2. Twitter (algorithm favors new accounts)
3. Facebook Groups (join, post, earn)
4. Quora (answer questions, drop links)
5. LinkedIn (post daily, build audience)

You can start TODAY with zero followers and make your first sale within 48 hours.

Proof: I made $500 in my first week with 0 followers.

[CTA: Start Your First Post Today]

Best,
ToolFlow Team
```

**Email 7: Final Push (Send Day 6)**
```
Subject: Your First Commission is Waiting (Action Required)

Hi [First Name],

You've learned:
✓ How to earn $200-2,000 per sale
✓ Where to find buyers
✓ How to post without an audience
✓ Real examples of affiliates earning

Now it's time to take action.

Pick ONE tool (Shopify or GetResponse).
Pick ONE platform (Reddit or Twitter).
Make ONE post today.

That's it. One post could make you $200-500.

[CTA: Get Your First Affiliate Link]

P.S. - Most affiliates who take action in their first week make their first sale within 7 days. Don't be the one who reads this and does nothing.

Best,
ToolFlow Team

A: No! You can promote directly from social media. But having a website (like ToolFlow) increases conversions by 50%.

**Q: Can I get banned from affiliate programs?**
A: Only if you:
- Use misleading claims
- Spam
- Violate terms of service

Just be honest and follow the rules.

**Q: How much can I realistically make?**
A: 
- Conservative: $1,400-2,800/month
- Moderate: $5,000-10,000/month
- Aggressive: $20,000+/month

It depends on how much you promote and how good your traffic is.
